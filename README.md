# OutriX_tasks â€“ Task 1

This repository contains **Task 1: Stock Price Trend Analysis** for my Finance Analytics Internship with OutriX.

**What I Did:**
- Fetched Apple's historical stock data using Python and yfinance.
- Calculated daily returns, moving averages (20-day & 50-day), and rolling volatility.
- Created visualizations (stock price trends, daily return histogram, volatility chart) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Key Insight:**  
The moving averages show long-term trends, and volatility spikes highlight periods of higher risk.

## Task 2: Portfolio Risk & Return Analysis

In this task, I analyzed the risk and return of a portfolio consisting of multiple stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN) using Python.

### Key Components:
- Downloaded historical stock price data using `yfinance`.
- Calculated **daily returns**, **expected annual return**, **portfolio volatility**, and **Sharpe ratio**.
- Used `NumPy` and `Pandas` for calculations and data processing.
- Visualized:
  - **Cumulative returns** to show portfolio growth.
  - **Correlation heatmap** to assess diversification.
- Provided performance insights based on risk-return metrics.

> Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, yfinance, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
