# OutriX_tasks â€“ Task 1

This repository contains **Task 1: Stock Price Trend Analysis** for my Finance Analytics Internship with OutriX.

**What I Did:**
- Fetched Apple's historical stock data using Python and yfinance.
- Calculated daily returns, moving averages (20-day & 50-day), and rolling volatility.
- Created visualizations (stock price trends, daily return histogram, volatility chart) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Key Insight:**  
The moving averages show long-term trends, and volatility spikes highlight periods of higher risk.
